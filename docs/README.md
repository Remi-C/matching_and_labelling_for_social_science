# Collaborative Matching and Labelling for Social Science #

## Brief summary ##
  This project is an open source tool for collaborative editing of data. It is intended to assist researchers in disambiguating their data. Thus, it gives them the opportunity to increase the accuracy of and find new connections in the data. 
  
  The program is especially useful for text classification. Researchers will be able to provide text files as input, as well as an intermediate file that includes contextual information (predictions, images, etc.). From there, researchers, along with their teams and colleagues, will be able to use the collaborative match system as leverage for more better informed research.
